= Travis's assorted Philips Hue lighting toys

This is a collection of little scripts and tools that I have developed while tinkering around with the http://www2.meethue.com/en-us[Philips Hue] smart lighting system. Many are just for fun, some are rather esoteric, and others may even be useful; your mileage may vary.

“Hue Personal Wireless Lighting” is a trademark of Philips Lighting Holding B.V.
The author(s) of this software are in no way affiliated with Philips.

== Requirements

Currently, everything here assumes the use of white and color ambiance lamps, and may outright fail on anything else.
I don't even have anything other than the full-color lamps at the moment, so I have no ability to even test compatibility with ambiance- or white-only lights.

This project requires the https://github.com/studioimaginaire/phue[phue Python library].

== Installation

The package can be installed with pip.
For instance, with the contents of this repo (where setup.py is located) located at <path/to/package>:

pip install <path/to/package>

Or, for a user-local installation:

pip install --user <path/to/package>

== The programs

This collection includes the following:

=== fading_colors

with a + or - to add or subtract the value from the light's current
setting instead of setting it directly to that value. Color temperature
will be limited to Hue's supported range of 153–500 mired or 2000–6535
Kelvin if such relative inputs are used, though setting absolute values
outside this range are allowed and will be simulated if necessary.

  -Bc BRIDGE_CONFIG, --bridge-config BRIDGE_CONFIG

                        interval to poll for light state in seconds (default:
                        60)
  -i, --individual-mode
                        restore lights individually when reset, rather than
                        restoring only all lights as a group when they all are
                        in initial power-up state

If no lights are specified, all lights found on the bridge will be
used.

The first time this script is run on a system, it may be necessary to
press the button on the bridge before running the script so that it can
be registered to access the bridge and lighting system.

=== incandescent_fade

A program that fades lights up or down with a tungsten-like appearance, simulating the color shift of a dimmed incandescent bulb

----
usage: incandescent_fade [-h] [-v] [-B BRIDGE_ADDRESS] [-Bu BRIDGE_USERNAME]
                         [-Bc BRIDGE_CONFIG] [-l LIGHT-NUM [LIGHT-NUM ...]]

                         start_brightness final_brightness fade_time

Simulate an incandescent dimmer fade

positional arguments:
  start_brightness      the starting brightness level (1–254); 0 is off
  final_brightness      the ending brightness level (1–254); 0 is off
  fade_time             number of seconds to perform the fade

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         output extra informational messages (and debug
                        messages if specified more than once)
  -B BRIDGE_ADDRESS, --bridge BRIDGE_ADDRESS
                        Hue bridge IP or hostname
  -Bu BRIDGE_USERNAME, --bridge-username BRIDGE_USERNAME
                        Hue bridge username
  -Bc BRIDGE_CONFIG, --bridge-config BRIDGE_CONFIG
                        path of config file for bridge connection parameters
  -l LIGHT-NUM [LIGHT-NUM ...], --light-id LIGHT-NUM [LIGHT-NUM ...]
                        use light(s) with ID number LIGHT-NUM
  -ln LIGHT-NAME [LIGHT-NAME ...], --light-name LIGHT-NAME [LIGHT-NAME ...]
                        use light(s) named LIGHT-NAME
  --restore-lights      return lights to their original state on exit

If no lights are specified, all lights found on the bridge will be
used.

The first time this script is run on a system, it may be necessary to
press the button on the bridge before running the script so that it can
be registered to access the bridge and lighting system.

=== alt_lamp_simulation

Roughly simulates the power-on behavior of certain non-LED lights.

----
usage: alt_lamp_simulation [-h] [-v] [-B BRIDGE_ADDRESS] [-Bu BRIDGE_USERNAME]
                           [-Bc BRIDGE_CONFIG] [-l LIGHT-NUM [LIGHT-NUM ...]]
                           [-ln LIGHT-NAME [LIGHT-NAME ...]]
                           [--restore-lights] [-m {cfl_2700k,cfl_3500k,sbm}]
                           [-w {deep,shallow,random}] [-t TIME_RATE]

Simulate certain types of non-LED lamps with their power-on warm-up
behaviors

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         output extra informational messages (and debug
                        messages if specified more than once)
  -B BRIDGE_ADDRESS, --bridge BRIDGE_ADDRESS
                        Hue bridge IP or hostname
  -Bu BRIDGE_USERNAME, --bridge-username BRIDGE_USERNAME
                        Hue bridge username
  -Bc BRIDGE_CONFIG, --bridge-config BRIDGE_CONFIG
                        path of config file for bridge connection parameters
  -l LIGHT-NUM [LIGHT-NUM ...], --light-id LIGHT-NUM [LIGHT-NUM ...]
                        use light(s) with ID number LIGHT-NUM
  -ln LIGHT-NAME [LIGHT-NAME ...], --light-name LIGHT-NAME [LIGHT-NAME ...]
                        use light(s) named LIGHT-NAME
  --restore-lights      return lights to their original state on exit
  -m {cfl_2700k,cfl_3500k,sbm}, --model {cfl_2700k,cfl_3500k,sbm}
                        light model to simulate; if specified multiple times,
                        a randomly-chosen model out of the ones specified will
                        be selected for each light
  -w {deep,shallow,random}, --warmup-type {deep,shallow,random}
                        variation of warmup to simulate; only applies to CFL
                        simulation models (default: random)
  -t TIME_RATE, --time-rate TIME_RATE
                        time rate of simulation (e.g., 2 = double speed, 0.5 =
                        half speed) (default: 1.0)

If no lights are specified, all lights found on the bridge will be
used.
